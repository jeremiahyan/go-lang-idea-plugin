Package io provides basic interfaces to I/O primitives.<br/>Its primary job is to wrap existing implementations of such primitives,<br/>such as those in package os, into shared public interfaces that<br/>abstract the functionality, plus some other related primitives.<br/><br/>Because these interfaces and primitives wrap lower-level operations with<br/>various implementations, unless otherwise informed clients should not<br/>assume they are safe for parallel execution.
